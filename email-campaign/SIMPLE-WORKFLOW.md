# ✅ SIMPLE MANUAL INSTAGRAM WORKFLOW

**No automation. No complexity. Just works.**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

**You describe what you want → I create it → Preview in Slack → You approve → I post it**

---

## 📱 Two Ways to Use

### Option 1: Just Tell Me What You Want

In this chat, just describe your Instagram post:
- "Weekend wine sale - 30% off all red wines"
- "New craft beer arrivals - limited stock"
- "Cocktail recipe: Margarita Monday"

I'll create the post with:
- ✅ Professional caption with store info
- ✅ Relevant hashtags
- ✅ Appropriate image
- ✅ Send preview to Slack #social-media-approvals

You just say "post it" and I'll publish it immediately.

### Option 2: Use the Script

```bash
# Interactive mode - asks you step by step
node manual-instagram-post.js

# Command line - quick one-liner
node manual-instagram-post.js "Your post description here"
```

## 📋 What Gets Created Automatically

When you describe a post, I automatically:

1. **Detect category** (wine, beer, liquor, cocktail, store)
2. **Pick appropriate image** from curated library
3. **Generate caption** with:
   - Emoji (🍷/🍺/🍸/🛍️)
   - Your description
   - Store name, address, phone
   - Relevant hashtags
4. **Send preview** to Slack for you to review
5. **Post to Instagram** when you approve

## 🖼️ Image Library

Categories automatically matched to descriptions:
- **Wine** keywords: wine, red, white, bottle
- **Beer** keywords: beer, craft, ale, IPA
- **Liquor** keywords: liquor, vodka, whiskey, spirits
- **Cocktail** keywords: cocktail, drink, mix, recipe
- **Store** keywords: store, shop, visit, location

Each category has 2-5 professional stock images that rotate randomly.
